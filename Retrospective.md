## Experience

lots of syntaxes to reread on and function calls/methods/etc... Finished this in the am with an hour before work, I dont have energy to leave

## Known issues or Bugs

hopefully none, website looks good - example code for pug file was buggy for me and rather trying to debug it I just tried using another method
